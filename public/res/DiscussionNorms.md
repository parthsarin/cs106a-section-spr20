# Discussion Norms

1. Smaller size questions should be asked in the chat, rather than by unmuting yourself and talking.
2. Maintain respect towards each other and the class material, despite an online setting.
3. Interruptions are inevitable, but try not to talk over others.
4. Problems and discussions should try to focus on content that is as similar to class as possible.
5. No question is a bad question.
