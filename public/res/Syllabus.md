Section Overview
----------------

We'll meet once a week for section. Generally, during section, we'll talk through problems that Cynthia has written for us to cover. The problems will cover material from lecture and you'll receive a handout with the problems during section. We probably won't get through all of the problems during section; that's intentional -- you can use the rest of the problems to practice with. Finally, you may not use your laptop during section.

Section attendance is mandatory and part of your grade (5%) is dependent on coming to section. If you miss a section, don't worry: you should attend a makeup section with a different section leader and then send me an email with the time and location of the section you attended. You can find a list of the other sections at <https://cs198.stanford.edu/>.

Interactive Grading (IG) Sessions
---------------------------------

You'll receive your grades on submitted assignments through "interactive grading" ("IG") sessions. After I've graded your assignment, I'll create a form where you can sign up to meet with me for 20 minutes (usually at CoHo or somewhere else in Tressider). You do not need to bring your laptop to an IG. At our meeting, we'll discuss your assignment submission and you'll get your grade. We'll probably also exchange lots of high fives. I generally hold IGs on the weekends. If that doesn't work for you, we can make other arrangements; just send me an email. For the lateness policy, see the course information handout: <http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b//handouts/course-information.pdf>.

Contacting Me
-------------

If you have any questions, jokes, musings, etc., shoot me an email. I'm very responsive to email, and I'll generally respond within 24 hours (but usually much faster). If you don't hear back from me in a day, send me a gentle reminder. Feel free to contact me about (almost) anything -- CS related or otherwise. That said, there are other resources available to you in this course, including...

-   Office Hours with Cynthia (the instructor) and Katherine (the head TA). See the course website for more details.

-   Piazza. You can post questions on Piazza and get answers from fellow students and instructors. See the course website for more details.

-   LaIR. Bring your code to the LaIR to get help with the assignment from section leaders. The LaIR is on the first floor of Tressider and is open Sunday -- Thursday, 7pm -- 11pm (except holidays).
