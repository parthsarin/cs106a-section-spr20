Welcome to CS 106A! I'm your section leader, Parth. It's been a crazy few weeks; this class is happening at a very unusual time in the world. Honestly, I'm not sure what this quarter will look like, but I promise we're going to have a lot of fun. Here's the plan for section this quarter:

## What is Section?
CS 106A has a discussion section component. We'll meet once a week and generally, we'll talk through problems that the course staff have selected for us. The problems will cover material from lecture and there will be a handout with the problems posted on the website.

We probably won't get through all of the problems during section; that's intentional: you can use the rest of the problems to practice with.

Section attendance is mandatory and part of your grade (**TODO**) is dependent on coming to section. If you miss a section you should attend a makeup section with a different section leader and then send me an email with the time and location of the section you attended. You can find a list of the other sections at <https://cs198.stanford.edu/>.

## Interactive Grading (IG) Sessions
You'll receive your grades on submitted assignments through "interactive grading" ("IG") sessions. After I've graded your assignment, I'll create a form where you can sign up to meet with me for 20 minutes. At our meeting, we'll discuss your assignment submission and you'll get your grade. 

IGs are also a lot of fun! I want to get to know each of you, individually and I'm excited to learn about what you hope to get out of this class. I generally hold IGs on the weekends. If that doesn't work for you, we can make other arrangements; just send me an email. For the lateness policy, see the course information handout: **TODO**.

## Okay, but this quarter is weird...
Yeah. It absolutely is. We're holding section on Zoom this quarter. I'm going to do my best to keep things running as smoothly as possible, but this is new for all of us, and we'll undoubtedly run into some hiccups.

Here's what I'm going to do to make section as accessible and normal as possible:
- Before every section, I'll post links to resources we'll use during the section including PDFs of any slides and a ZIP file containing any code that we'll run. These are to help you follow along during section.
- During section, as much as possible, I'll try to use captioning software to put a live transcription of what I'm saying on the screen. This software tends not to be very accurate with my voice, but hopefully it'll be helpful!
- After every section, I'll post a recap on the homepage of this website, in the appropriate tab of the Schedule. Here's the link to the homepage: <https://dev.parthsarin.com/section/#/>.
- I'll also post a link to a transcribed recording of section, for your reference.
- The CS 106A course staff has a tremendous amount of sympathy for you right now. There's a lot going on that's more important than 106A and I get that. I'll keep this in mind as much as possible. &#128522;

Here's what I need from you to make section run smoothly:
- Try your best to follow our Zoom Policies (see below for more details).
- Communicate with me as much as possible. I'll probably be your primary point of contact with CS 106A so it's extra important that I know how the class is going for you. Seriously, feel free to email me about anything.
- In CS 106A, we're doing our best to deliver a meaningful course experience, working within the university's pandemic response policies. But, we're not perfect. More than anything else on this list, I'd appreciate your patience and sympathy as we all try to figure this out. &#128579;

### Zoom Policies
#### General Policies
1. Please try to **have your camera on during section**! Since we're a small class, I hope this'll help foster a collaborative atmosphere.
	* If this is difficult or impossible for you, shoot me an email before section starts.
2. **Mute yourself when you aren't talking** to reduce background noise.
3. If possible, **use headphones or earbuds** to reduce background noise.

#### Participation
1. **Use the chat to ask questions**, and do so frequently! If you'd like to ask your question anonymously, you can message me directly and I won't single you out.
2. I find Zoom's **non-verbal feedback features** (raise hand, yes, no, go slower, go faster, etc) to be unreliable and difficult to respond to. Try to refrain from using that feature—I probably won't notice it—and use the chat for reactions instead.

## Contacting Me / Other Resources
If you have any questions, jokes, musings, etc., shoot me an email. I'm very responsive to email, and I'll generally respond within 24 hours (but usually much faster). If you don't hear back from me in a day, please send me a gentle reminder. 

Feel free to contact me about (almost) anything—CS related or otherwise. That said, there are other resources available to you in this course, including...
- *Office Hours with Chris, Mehran, and Brahm (the instructors and head TA)*. See the course website for more details.
- *EdStem*. You can post questions on EdStem and get answers from fellow students and instructors. Here's the link to the EdStem site for CS 106A: <https://us.edstem.org/join/9H2UXg>.
- *Virtual LaIR*. Bring your code to the LaIR to get help with the assignment from section leaders. For safety reasons, the LaIR is virtual this quarter and is open Sunday—Thursday, 7pm—11pm (except holidays). To join the LaIR queue during that time, you should go to this link: **TODO**.
