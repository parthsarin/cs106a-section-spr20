Today, we'll briefly cover some logistics and go do some icebreakers, but we'll spend most of our time on a review of lecture and two problems.

#### Logistics
There are two main logistical notes I want to make:
1. Assignment 2 (Khan-sole Academy and Compute Interest) is being graded and IGs will happen over the weekend.
2. The diagnostic was on Monday and I hope it went well! A few people have asked to discuss the exam; Iâ€™m happy to talk about it after grades are released.

#### Lecture Review
We'll touch on functions one more time to summarize all we've learned so far. A function is like a black box that does something in your program. You can think of it as a *task* that your computer will perform. Functions can take in *parameters* and spit out *return values*, though neither of those are required.

When we define a function, we make two promises. We specify what parameters the function will take in (between the paranthesis) and what the function will return (in the body of the function, after the `return` statement).
```python
def some_function(param_one, param_two): # the parameters
    # unicorn magic
    return return_value # the value to return
```

We'll also talk about images and how to manipulate them in Python. We'll use the `SimpleImage` library, which allows us to load images into our computer and manipulate them in terms of pixels. Pixels are the small single-colored squares that make up our image.
```python
img = SimpleImage(filename) # loads the image

img.width   # => the number of pixels along the x axis
img.height  # => the number of pixels along the y axis
```

We can access individual pixels using `px = img.get_pixel(x, y)`. That function will return a pixel object which has a red, green, and blue value that we can access and manipulate with `px.red`, `px.green`, and `px.blue` respectively.

You can iterate over an image with a for-each loop:
```python
for px in img:
    # do some stuff with px
```
or with a loop over the dimensions of the image:
```python
for y in range(img.height):
    for x in range(img.width):
        px = img.get_pixel(x, y)
        # do some stuff with px (and optionally x, y)
```

Both of these loops go through the image in the same order, but the second allows you to access the `x` and `y` coordinates of each pixel.

#### Problems!
The two section problems we'll focus on today are **Fizzbuzz** and **Squeeze Width**. We'll do the first one together, as a group, and you'll do the second in your breakout rooms.
