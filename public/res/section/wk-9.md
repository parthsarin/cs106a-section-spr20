I've decided to make section this week *optional*, because I don't want it to contribute to any stress you may be experiencing right now. Swing by to talk about anything, if you'd like!

Instead of giving the usual spiel I like to give at the end of every section, I've written down some thoughts here.

<blockquote>
    <p style="display: block;">Last quarter, I talked to the founder of Python, Guido van Rossum (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cIFVaiN2xosLusZoMkXt44pm-buN9lIT/view?usp=sharing">full Q&A here</a>). Towards the end of our conversation, I asked him "What do you hope people will do with Python?" His answer was simple (and perhaps a little corny): "I hope youâ€™ll keep surprising me."</p>
    <p style="display: block;">This quarter, youâ€™ve all done just that: each and every one of you has surprised me. Under enormously difficult circumstances, youâ€™ve managed to learn this material to a truly dazzling level of comprehension. Congratulations. Thatâ€™s an achievement worth celebrating.</p>
    <p style="display: block;">On the first day of class, I mentioned that Iâ€™m not a computer science major. The most advanced CS course Iâ€™ve taken is CS 106B (and an SL training course, if you count that). Thatâ€™s because I think my time is better spent thinking about other problems. CS is an incredibly powerful tool to help tackle those problems, but itâ€™s not a panacea. I hope my experience debunks a myth: you donâ€™t need to major in CS to be a computer scientist. CS is just about solving problems using computers and all of you know how to do that.</p>
    <p style="display: block;">As the quarter comes to a close, I hope youâ€™ll seek out problems that youâ€™re interested in solving and find that in many cases, your new CS knowledge can make a real difference in how you approach them. Knowing you, I know you can solve most problems you put your mind to... So really, I only have two questions: <b>Which problems do you want to solve? And why do you want to solve them?</b></p>
    <p style="display: block;">Stay curious, solve important problems, and keep surprising me.</p>
    <p style="display: block;">
    With love and ðŸ¦„s, one last time,<br />
    Parth
    </p>
