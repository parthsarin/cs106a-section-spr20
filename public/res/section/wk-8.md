Hey folks, I was going to have section normally today, but I noticed this... Can you help me get to the bottom of it?

<blockquote>
    <p style="display: block;">Hello Chris and Mehran,</p>
    <p style="display: block;">It’s been really great to help the students in your class! I get a little lonely after week 2, but I can always look forward to the next quarter.</p>
    <p style="display: block;">At the moment, I’m on a prolonged vacation, and I wanted to just let you both know that even though you haven’t seen me recently, I’m totally fine. Absolutely, completely fine. Don’t come looking for me, because I’m fine. Totally fine.</p>
    <p style="display: block;">In fact, let me tell you about the HIGHLIGHT of my day. I love HIGHLIGHTs, and I hope this will HIGHLIGHT what I have to say.</p>
    <p style="display: block;">Today, I went on a walk,</p>

    <p style="display: block;">And when I went outside my house, I found a newspaper! It was great. </p>
    <p style="display: block;">I hope you liked that HIGHLIGHT of my day, and I hope you can see the HIGHLIGHT in it too!</p>
    <p style="display: block;">Best wishes,<br />Karel</p>
